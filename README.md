# Newton-Laws-of-Motion
These functions will help to find the solution for the problems based on the Newton Laws of Motions.
These functions are given as functions , so that when you try to run them they interactively asks you to give input values on Command window. For the given Values it calculate and gives the result back to you on your command window. 

Example : 

>> firstlaw % you don't need to write anything after the function. Just call the function by its name
% then on command window you will be asked to u, a, t values as shown below.
u:4
a:5
t:6
Your speed after 6 sec is 34 m/s
Similarly for the other laws.
